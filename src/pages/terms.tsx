          </ul>
        </Section>

        <Section title="4. Payment Terms">
          <p>
            All prices are quoted in Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) and exclude SST
            unless stated otherwise. Payment terms are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul className="flex list-inside list-disc flex-col gap-2 pl-1">
            <li>

                Integration projects
              </span>{' '}
              — 50% deposit upon project acceptance, 50% upon go-live or 30 days
              after build completion, whichever is earlier.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium text-neutral-800">
                Monthly maintenance and SaaS plans
              </span>{' '}
              — billed monthly or annually in advance. Subscriptions auto-renew
              unless cancelled before the next billing date.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Invoices are due within 14 days of issuance. Late payments may incur
            a 1.5% monthly interest charge. We reserve the right to suspend
            services for accounts overdue by more than 30 days.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="5. Delivery and Go-Live">
          <p>
            Estimated delivery timelines (7–14 days for standard integrations)
            are provided in good faith and are contingent on timely client
            cooperation, system access, and data availability. Zylen is not
            liable for delays caused by incomplete information, restricted
            access, or changes to LHDN MyInvois requirements outside our
            control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go-live is defined as the successful validation of your integration
            against the LHDN MyInvois production environment. All integrations
            undergo full sandbox testing before go-live.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="6. Intellectual Property">
          <p>
            For fixed-price integration projects, upon receipt of full payment,
            you own the source code of the integration built specifically for
            your system. General frameworks, utilities, and proprietary
            middleware components developed by Zylen remain our intellectual
            property.
          </p>
          <p>
            All website content, branding, and materials on zylen.tech are owned
            by Zylen and may not be reproduced without written permission.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="7. LHDN Compliance Disclaimer">
          <p>
            Zylen builds integrations to the official LHDN MyInvois API
            specification and runs full sandbox validation prior to go-live.
            However, final approval and acceptance of e-invoices by LHDN is
            subject to the accuracy of your business data, your LHDN
            registration status, and LHDN&apos;s own systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are not affiliated with LHDN (Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia)
            and cannot guarantee LHDN&apos;s decisions regarding your
            submissions. Any fines, penalties, or enforcement actions by LHDN
            arising from your business operations or non-compliance prior to
            engaging Zylen are solely your responsibility.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="8. Limitation of Liability">
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by Malaysian law, Zylen shall not be
            liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive
            damages arising from your use of our services, including but not
            limited to loss of business, revenue, data, or LHDN penalties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our total liability for any claim arising from our services shall
            not exceed the total fees paid by you to Zylen in the 3 months
            preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="9. Termination">
          <p>
            Either party may terminate an engagement by providing 14 days&apos;
            written notice. For monthly subscriptions, cancellation takes effect
            at the end of the current billing period. No refunds are issued for
            partial months.
          </p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to terminate access immediately if you breach
            these terms, fail to pay outstanding invoices, or engage in conduct
            that we deem harmful to our business or other clients.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="10. Confidentiality">
          <p>
            Both parties agree to keep confidential any proprietary or sensitive
            information exchanged during the course of the engagement. This
            includes your business data, invoice records, system credentials,
            and our proprietary integration methodologies. This obligation
            survives termination of the engagement.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="11. Governing Law">
          <p>
            These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance
            with the laws of Malaysia. Any disputes arising from these terms or
            our services shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
            courts of Malaysia.
